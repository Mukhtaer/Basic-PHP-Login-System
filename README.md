# Basic-PHP-Login-System

This is a basic login system built in PHP, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

## Description

The login system consists of a simple HTML login form that sends an AJAX request to a PHP script to validate the user's credentials. The PHP script checks the username and password against a hardcoded value and returns a JSON response with a success flag and message. The JavaScript code handles the response and displays appropriate messages to the user.


## Usage

1. Enter the username and password.
2. Click the "Login" button.
3. The system will validate the credentials and display a success or error message.
